# ðŸš² Bike Sales Analysis â€“ Excel Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores bike purchase behavior across different customer demographics using Excel. The dataset contained information such as income, occupation, marital status, gender, number of children, age group, education, region, and commute distance.  
The goal was to clean the dataset, perform exploratory analysis using pivot tables, and design an interactive Excel dashboard with slicers and charts to identify customer groups most likely to purchase bikes.

## ðŸ”Ž Process
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates and inconsistencies  
   - Standardized categorical fields (e.g., marital status, gender)
   - Added calculated columns for:
      - **Age Brackets**: 25â€“34, 35â€“44, 45â€“54, 55â€“64, 65+  
      - **Income Brackets**: 10kâ€“20k, 20kâ€“40k, 40kâ€“60k, 60kâ€“80k, 80k-100k, 100k-150k, 150k+ 
   - Filtered dataset down to 1,000 usable records  

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Created pivot tables to examine relationships between demographics and bike purchases  
   - Used slicers for filtering by age, income, region, etc.  

3. **Dashboard Design**  
   - Built an interactive Excel dashboard  
   - Added slicers and charts for quick filtering and visualization of trends

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
- **Marital Status**: Single people are more likely to purchase a bike compared to married individuals  
- **Children**: As the number of children increases, the likelihood of bike purchase decreases  
- **Commute Distance**: Longer commute distances reduce the probability of purchasing a bike  
- **Age Group**: Customers aged **35â€“44** showed the highest likelihood of bike ownership
